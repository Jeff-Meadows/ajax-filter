Chrome Extension to filter AJAX responses

What is this?
-------------

Inspired by a hackathon project to filter out some unwanted data from a dashboard, this extension can be used to apply a
[JSON Patch](http://jsonpatch.com/) to JSON AJAX responses.

How to use it
-------------

Install the extension by downloading it and loading the extension as unpacked.  Open the options page, enter a URL pattern
you'd like to filter AJAX responses on, and then enter the patch instructions you'd like to apply.
